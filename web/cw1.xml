        <h2>Content of the lab</h2>
        <p>
            The text of the lab is in the indexer notebook available here
                <a href="https://github.com/pnugues/edan20/tree/master/notebooks">
                    https://github.com/pnugues/edan20/tree/master/notebooks
                </a>
        </p>
        <!--<h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/pnugues/ilppp/raw/master/programs/corpus/Selma.zip">Selma
                folder</a> and uncompress it. It contains novels by <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_Lagerl%C3%B6f">
                Selma Lagerlöf</a>. The text of these novels was extracted
                from <a href="https://litteraturbanken.se/forfattare/LagerlofS/titlar">Lagerlöf arkivet</a> at
                <a href="https://litteraturbanken.se/">Litteraturbanken</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Read the description of the tf-idf measure on Wikipedia
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf</a>).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Programming the Indexer</h2>
        <p>Your program will take a corpus as input (here the Selma novels) and
            produce an index of all the words with their positions. you should be able to run it this way:
        </p>
        <pre>$ python indexer.py folder_name</pre>
        <p>Conceptually, the index will consist of rows with one word per row and
            and the list of files and positions, where this word occurs. Such a row is
            called a posting list.
            You will encode the position of a word by the number of characters from the start of the file.
        </p>
        <pre>
word1: file_name pos1 pos2 pos3... file_name pos1 pos2 ...
word2: file_name pos1 pos2 pos3... file_name pos1 pos2 ...
...
        </pre>
        <p>To make programming easier, you will split this exercise into three steps and you will use
            dictionaries to represent the postings.
        </p>
        <h3>Indexing one file</h3>
        <p>Write a program that reads one document <tt>file_name.txt</tt> and outputs an index file:
            <tt>file_name.idx</tt>:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The index file will contain all the unique words in the document,
                where each word is associated with the list of its positions in the document.
            </li>
            <li>You will represent this index as a dictionary where the keys will be the words and
                the values, the lists of positions
            </li>
            <li>As words, you will consider all the strings of letters that you will set in lower case.
                You will not index the rest (i.e. numbers, punctuations, or symbols).
            </li>
            <li>To extract the words, you will use Unicode regular expressions. Do not use <tt>\w+</tt>,
                for instance, but the Unicode equivalent.
            </li>
            <li>The word positions will correspond to the number of characters from the beginning of the file.
                (The word offset from the beginning)
            </li>
            <li>You will use <tt>finditer()</tt> to find the positions of the words.
                This will return you match objects,
                where you will get the matches and the positions with
                the <tt>group()</tt> and <tt>start()</tt> methods.
            </li>
            <li>You will use the pickle package to write your dictionary in an file,
                see <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle">https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle</a>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Below is an excerpt of the index of the bannlyst text for the words <i>gjord</i>, <i>uppklarnande</i>, and
            <i>stjärnor</i>. The data is stored in a dictionary:
        </p>
        <pre>
{...
'gjord': [8600, 183039, 220445],
'uppklarnande': [8617],
'stjärnor': [8641], ...
}
        </pre>
        <p>The word <i>gjord</i> occurs three times in the text at positions 8600, 183039, and 220445, <i>uppklarnande</i>, once at
            position 8617, and <i>stjärnor</i>, once at position 8641.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading the content of a folder</h3>
        <p>Write a function that reads all the files in a folder with a specific suffix (txt). You will need the Python
            os package,
            see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html</a>. You
            will return the file names in a list.
        </p>
        <p>You can reuse this function:</p>
        <pre>
        def get_files(dir, suffix):
            """
            Returns all the files in a folder ending with suffix
            :param dir:
            :param suffix:
            :return: the list of file names
            """
            files = []
            for file in os.listdir(dir):
                if file.endswith(suffix):
                    files.append(file)
            return files
        </pre>

        <h3>Creating a master index</h3>
        <p>Complete your program with the creation of master index, where you will associate each word
            of the corpus with the files, where it occur and its positions. (a posting list)
        </p>
        <p>Below is an except of the master index with the words <i>samlar</i> and <i>ände</i>:
        </p>
        <pre>
'samlar':
            {'troll.txt': [641880, 654233],
            'nils.txt': [51805, 118943],
            'osynliga.txt': [399121],
            'gosta.txt': [313784, 409998, 538165]}
'ände':
            {'troll.txt': [39562, 650112],
            'kejsaren.txt': [50171],
            'marbacka.txt': [370324],
            'nils.txt': [1794],
            'osynliga.txt': [272144]}
        </pre>
        <p>The word <i>samlar</i>, for instance, occurs three times in the gosta text at positions
            313784, 409998, and 538165.
        </p>
        <h2>Representing Documents with tf-idf</h2>
        <p>Once you have created the index, you will represent each document in your corpus as a word vector.
            You will define the value of a word in a document with the tf-idf
            metric. Tf will be the relative frequency of the term in the document and idf, the logarithm base 10 of the
            inverse document
            frequency.
        </p>
        <p>You have below the tf-idf values for a few words. In our example, the word <i>gås</i> has the value
            0 in bannlyst.txt and the value 0.000101001964 in nils.txt
        </p>

        <h2>Comparing Documents</h2>
        <p>Using the cosine similarity, compare all the pairs of documents with their tfidf representation and present
            your results in a matrix. You will include this matrix in your report.
        </p>
        <p>Give the name of the two novels that are the most similar.</p>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>Read the text:
            <i>Challenges in Building Large-Scale Information Retrieval Systems</i>
            about the history of
            <a href="https://research.google.com/people/jeff/WSDM09-keynote.pdf">Google indexing</a>
            by
            <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/jeff.html">Jeff Dean</a>.
            In your report, tell how your index encoding is related to what Google did.
            You must identify the slide where you have the most similar indexing technique and write the
            slide number in your report.
