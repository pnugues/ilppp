        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically, each assignment is done by a group of two students. The programming results of it are shown
                to the instructor who validates it during a laboratory session. You can register to a laboratory group here: <a
                        href="https://sam.cs.lth.se/LabsSelectSession?occasionId=552">
                    https://sam.cs.lth.se/LabsSelectSession?occasionId=552</a>.
            </li>
            <li>After the lab, each and every student writes a report of one to two pages to describe how s/he carried
                out the assignment, her/his results, and gives a conclusion. You need both to validate your program and
                hand in a short report to complete your assignment. You can use <a href="https://v2.overleaf.com">
                    overleaf
                </a> to write this report.
            </li>
            <li>Attendance to the laboratory sessions is compulsory. If you are unable to attend, you must report it to
                your instructor.
            </li>
            <li>We will use Python and scikit-learn in the assignments. The laboratory session of week 1 (lab 0) is
                intended to review some basic features of Python as well as scikit-learn.
                <br/>Group 1/2, September 4, 2018, 08:15 to 10:00, in the Beta room, group 3, September 4, 2018, 13:15 to
                15:00, in the Beta room, and group 4, September 4,
                2018, 15:15 to 17:00, in the Beta room.

                by Peter Norvig to make sure you understand Python. You also have to hand in a short individual report
                describing the program. The report length should be of one to two pages.
