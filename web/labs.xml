        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically, each assignment is done by a group of two students. The programming results of it are shown
                to the instructor who validates it during a laboratory session. You can register to a laboratory group
                here: <a
                        href="https://sam.cs.lth.se/LabsSelectSession?occasionId=656">
                    https://sam.cs.lth.se/LabsSelectSession?occasionId=656</a>.
            </li>
            <li>After the lab, each and every student writes a report of one to two pages to describe how s/he carried
                out the assignment, her/his results, and gives a conclusion. You need both to validate your program and
                hand in a short report to complete your assignment. You must use <a href="https://overleaf.com">
                    overleaf
                </a> to write this report.
            </li>
            <li>Attendance to the laboratory sessions is compulsory. If you are unable to attend, you must report it to
                your instructor.
            </li>
            <li>We will use Python and scikit-learn in the assignments. The laboratory session of week 1 (lab 0) is
                intended to review some basic features of Python as well as scikit-learn.
